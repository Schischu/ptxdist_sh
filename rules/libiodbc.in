	  iODBC Driver Manager

	  iODBC (intrinsic Open Database Connectivity) driver manager
	  is compatible with ODBC 2.x and 3.x specification and
	  performs exact the jobs of a ODBC driver manager
	  (i.e. driver loading, Parameters and function sequence
	  checking, driver's function invoking, etc). Any ODBC driver
	  works with ODBC 2.0 and 3.x driver manager will also work
	  with iODBC driver manager and vice versa.

	  Applications (using ODBC function calls) linked with iODBC
	  driver manager will be able to simultaneously access
	  different type of data sources within one process through
	  suitable iODBC drivers.
